analysis of causal impact/removing the effect

Hello my name is Konrad and this is my CausalImpact repository

script1.R contains R package function which is used to analyse and remove the effect of CausalImpact based on probability of this effect
in different areas of impact - I divide the area into multiple smaller size places and I analyse them one by one .
CausalImpact, when observed(p>=0.75 and relative effect must be at least small, but still positive) is removed from the area by replacing it with projected values// there is still a little cheat because i replace the values with the actual data of function before introducing impact in 3 places. I plan to expand it by replacing the values with the predicted ones.
There is also much more to be done ... You shall see !!
